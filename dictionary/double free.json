	"description": "A double free vulnerability is a variant of a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability, and it occurs when a pointer is free()'d after it has already been free()'d. This can lead to numerous issues, including poisoning the target system's freelist, or introducing a use-after-free (UAF) on the re-allocated pointer.\n\nThey can be exploited to achieve memory corruption, DoS, and ultimately arbitrary code execution in some cases.",
