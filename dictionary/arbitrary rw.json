	"type": "Primitive",
	"description": "Arbitrary R/W is a very powerful primitive that an attacker can establish via exploiting a vulnerability. An attacker can seriously compromise a system with an arbitrary R/W primitive, as they can leak sensitive data out of memory, and ultimately achieve arbitrary code execution quite easily (such as by overwriting a function pointer).",
